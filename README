h1. Dupe tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to quickly and cleanly mock services with Dupe and Cucumber. We'll start with simple resource creation methods, and then DRY up our work using Dupe's facilities for quick resource prototyping.  

h2. Context

Let's assume we're going to create an application for browsing a library. The trick: we'll access the library books not through a database, but over services. For this, we'll use "ActiveResource", the rails library for managing restful resources. 

h2. Setting up our application

If you haven't already, install the following gems: cucumber, cucumber-rails, rspec, rspec-rails, webrat, dupe

Lets create our application:

<pre>
# rails library
# cd library
# script/generate cucumber
# script/generate rspec
# script/generate dupe
</pre>

Next, add dupe to your gem list in config/environments/cucumber.rb:

<pre>
config.gem "dupe"
</pre>

Also, since we'll be using HAML for our views in this tutorial, add "haml" to your gem list in config/environments.rb

<pre>
config.gem "haml"
</pre>

Lastly, since you won't be needing ActiveRecord, you might as well go ahead and remove it from the list of loaded libraries (config/environment.rb):

<pre>
config.frameworks -= [ :active_record]
</pre>

h2. Feature 1: List all books

Lets create a (naively) simple feature: viewing all books in the library. 

First, create the file features/books.feature, and add the following declarative scenario to it:

<pre>
<code class="cucumber">
Feature: Viewing all books in the library

  Scenario: the books index page
    Given the library has lots of books
    When I go to the books index page
    Then I should see all of the books in the library
</code>
</pre>

Next, run the feature (cucumber features/), watch it fail, then copy the missing step definitions into features/step_definitions/book_steps.rb.

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
Given /^the library has lots of books$/ do
  pending
end

Then /^I should see all of the books in the library$/ do
  pending
end
</code>
</pre>

At this point, we need to mock some resources. In a normal database-driven rails app, we would probably use a library like "Factory Girl" to help us quickly prototype some data, but our application is service-driven, we'll use "Dupe" to fake our services for the purposes of testing. 

Let's first consider translating "Given the library has lots of books" into a step definition. All we really want to do is to ensure that the library has a few books in it, so let's use Dupe to create a couple of books:

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
Given /^the library has lots of books$/ do
  Dupe.create :book, :name => "Rooby Rocks"
  Dupe.create :book, :name => "Rails Rocks too!"
end
</code>
</pre>

We've created two books, each with different names. When Dupe creates a resource, it will automatically assign a unique (sequentially assigned) "id" attribute to it, much like a database would. 

Next, let's implement "Then I should see all of the books in the library":

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
Then /^I should see all of the books in the library$/ do
  Then %{I should see "Rooby Rocks"}
  Then %{I should see "Rails Rocks too!"}
end
</code>
</pre>

All we've done here is translate our declarative statement into two more detailed ("imperative") statements. "I should see" matches a webrat step definition (if you don't know what webrat is, read up on it on github). 

Let's run our cucumber scenario again: 

<pre>
# cucumber features/
Feature: Viewing all books in the library

  Scenario: the books index page                      # features/books.feature:3
    Given the library has lots of books               # features/step_definitions/book_steps.rb:1
    When I go to the books index page                 # features/step_definitions/webrat_steps.rb:10
      Can't find mapping from "the books index page" to a path.
      Now, go and add a mapping in ./features/support/paths.rb (RuntimeError)
      ./features/support/paths.rb:22:in `path_to'
      ./features/step_definitions/webrat_steps.rb:11:in `/^I go to (.+)$/'
      features/books.feature:5:in `When I go to the books index page'
    Then I should see all of the books in the library # features/step_definitions/book_steps.rb:5


    Logged Requests:


Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/books.feature:3 # Scenario:
</pre>

It failed, but don't worry, that was expected. We have to tell webrat how to translate "the books index page" into a path. Open up features/support/paths.rb and add the following when condition into it: 

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
when /the books index page/
  books_path
</code>
</pre>

You'll also need to add a route for books to routes.rb: 

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  map.resources :books
end
</code>
</pre>

And though I'd normally recommend rspecc'ing the controller/models/views, for the sake of brevity, to help keep this tutorial focused on Dupe, we'll simply create them:

<pre>
# app/controllers/books_controller.rb

<code class="ruby">
class BooksController < ApplicationController
  def index 
    @books = Book.find :all
  end
end
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
# app/models/book.rb

<code class="ruby">
class Book < ActiveResource::Base
  # you can also just set this to an empty string, it doesn't
  # really matter since we don't yet have a service backend
  self.site = 'http://some.service.provider.com'
end
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
# app/views/books/index.haml

<code class="haml">
.books
  - @books.each do |book|
    .book
      .name
        = book.name
</code>
</pre>

Great! Now if we run "cucumber features/" again, they should all pass. 

h2. Updating Feature 1 to see the authors of books

Now let's suppose that our client has asked us to update this feature. In addition to seeing the titles of books, they also want to see the authors that wrote the books. 

In order to accomplish this, let's assume that a book has_one author, and update our step definitions accordingly: 

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
Given /^the library has lots of books$/ do
  Dupe.create :book, :name => "Rooby Rocks", :author => (Dupe.create :author, :name => 'Matz')
  Dupe.create :book, :name => "Rails Rocks too!", :author => (Dupe.create :author, :name => 'DHH')
end

Then /^I should see all of the books in the library$/ do
  Then %{I should see "Rooby Rocks"}
  Then %{I should see "by Matz"}
  Then %{I should see "Rails Rocks too!"}
  Then %{I should see "by DHH"}
end
</code>
</pre>

Run "cucumber features/", watch it fail, then update your view to make it pass: 

<pre>
# app/views/books/index.haml

<code class="haml">
.books
  - @books.each do |book|
    .book
      .name
        = book.name
      .author
        .name
          = "by #{book.author.name}"
</code>
</pre>

Now it should pass. 

h2. Refactor

Already, our step definitions are starting to look slightly unwieldy. Just imagine if the client asked us to display genres, publishers, descriptions, etc. Our "Given the library has lots of books" step definition would be clogged with resource creations. 

But don't worry, we've barely scratched the surface of what's possible with Dupe. Like Factory Girl, Dupe comes with a host of tools that make it possible for you to quickly create resources for the purposes of testing. 

We can start by defining exactly what a book should consist of. Create a new file features/dupe/definitions/books.rb: 

<pre>
# features/dupe/definitions/books.rb

<code class="ruby">
Dupe.define :book do |book|
  book.name
  book.author
end
</code>
</pre>

Basically, all we've said is that any book object should have "name" and "author" attributes. Now a "Dupe.create :book" will create a Duped book object with "name" and "author" attributes. The easiest way to see what I'm talking about is to fire up irb and try it out: 

<pre>
irb# require 'dupe'
  ==> true

irb# Dupe.define :book do |book|
 --#   book.name
 --#   book.author
 --# end

irb# Dupe.create :book
  ==> <#Duped::Book author=nil id=1 name=nil>

irb# Dupe.create :book
  ==> <#Duped::Book author=nil id=2 name=nil>
</pre>

Lets update our step definitions and see what happens: 

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
Given /^the library has lots of books$/ do
  Dupe.stub 2, :books
end

Then /^I should see all of the books in the library$/ do
  Dupe.find(:books).each do |book|
    Then %{I should see "#{book.name}"}
    Then %{I should see "by #{book.author.name}"}
  end
end
</code>
</pre>

Here I've introduced two new methods: Dupe.stub, and Dupe.find. Dupe.stub allows us to quickly generate an arbitrary number of resource (in this case two). It also supports a third argument of options, including a record template. Check out the API docs for more info (http://moonmaster9000.github.com/dupe/api/). 

Dupe.find allows us to find resources we've created. Later we'll see how to pass a proc to this method to filter the result set. In this case, Dupe.find(:books) will return an array of all books we've created. 

If you run "cucumber features/", it will fail. Why? "Dupe.stub 2, :books" created two book resources based on our book definition. However, our definition didn't specify any default values for the "name" and "author" attributes, so they simply got nil values. Obviously, we need actual data. Let's update our definition: 

<pre>
# features/dupe/definitions/books.rb

<code class="ruby">
Dupe.define :book do |book|
  book.name 'default name'
  book.author do 
    Dupe.create :author
  end
end

Dupe.define :author do |author|
  author.name 'default name'
end
</code>
</pre>

Now we're saying that a book should have both "name" and "author" attributes, that the "name" attribute should default to 'default name', and that the "author" attribute should default to a newly created "author" resource. We've also specified that an :author resource should have a "name" attribute defaulted to 'default name'. 

Again, lets drop down to irb to get a better picture of what this will give us: 

<pre>
irb# require 'dupe'
  ==> true

irb# Dupe.define :book do |book|
 --#   book.name 'default name'
 --#   book.author do 
 --#     Dupe.create :author
 --#   end
 --# end

irb# Dupe.define :author do |author|
 --#   author.name 'default name'
 --# end

irb# Dupe.create :book
  ==> <#Duped::Book author=<#Duped::Author name="default name" id=1> name="default name" id=1>

irb# Dupe.create :book
  ==> <#Duped::Book author=<#Duped::Author name="default name" id=2> name="default name" id=2>

irb# Dupe.create :book, :name => 'Rooby'
  ==> <#Duped::Book author=<#Duped::Author name="default name" id=3> name="Rooby" id=3>

irb# Dupe.create :book, :name => 'Rails', :author => (Dupe.create :author, :name => 'DHH')
  ==> <#Duped::Book author=<#Duped::Author name="DHH" id=4> name="Rails" id=4>
</pre>

You can see that each time we created a book, the book got both a name and an author. Dupe gave these attributes their appropriate default values when we didn't manually specify what the "name" or "author" attribute should be. 

Now let's run our cucumber feature again ("cucumber features/"). 

They pass! But wait! What did that view actually contain? It basically would have looked like: 

<pre>
  default name, by default name
  default name, by default name
</pre>

That's a pretty good indication that we haven't created very good test data, especially we could change the view to this and still have the feature passing: 

<pre>
# app/views/books/index.haml

<code class="haml">
.books
  - @books.each do |book|
    .book
      .name
        = book.name
      .author
        .name
          = "by #{book.name}"
</code>
</pre>

Notice that I've changed the display to set the author name to the book name. Since we created such poor test data, our feature still passes. 

So, how do we rectify this situation? Lets use the "uniquify" method:

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
Dupe.define :book do |book|
  book.uniquify :name
  book.author do 
    Dupe.create :author
  end
end

Dupe.define :author do |author|
  author.uniquify :name
end
</code>
</pre>

Notice the lines "book.uniquify :name" and "author.uniquify :name". Basically, Dupe will attempt to default the book name and author name on a newly created resource to a unique value. (I'll leave it to you to drop down to irb and test that out). 

Now run cucumber features (I'm assuming you still have the improper books/index.haml view). They fail as expected! No we've got better test data. Lets go back and fix our view: 
 
<pre>
# app/views/books/index.haml

<code class="haml">
.books
  - @books.each do |book|
    .book
      .name
        = book.name
      .author
        .name
          = "by #{book.author.name}"
</code>
</pre>

Now run "cucumber features/" and watch them pass. 

h2. Feature 2: Viewing all the books by a particular author. 

Lets assume our client would also like a page for viewing all the books by a particular author. We'll start with a new scenario: 

<pre>
# features/authors.feature
<code class="ruby">
Feature: Viewing content related to authors

  Scenario: the books written by a particular author page
    Given an author with many books
    When I view the books page for that author
    Then I should see the name of that author
    And I should see all of the books written by that author
</code>
</pre>

Next, let's define the step definitions for this:

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
Given /^an author with many books$/ do
  @author = Dupe.create :author
  @books = Dupe.stub 10, :books, :like => {:author => @author}
end

When /^I view the books page for that author$/ do
  When %{I go to the books page for the author with id "#{@author.id}"}
end

Then /^I should see the name of that author$/ do
  Then %{I should see "#{@author.name}"}
end

Then /^I should see all of the books written by that author$/ do
  @books.each do |book|
    Then %{I should see "#{book.name}"}
  end
end
</code>
</pre>

Notice that I've passed that third argument to stub I mentioned a while ago. For a detailed explanation, check the api docs, but suffice to say, I'm basically asking Dupe to give me 10 books, each with an author attribute with a value equal to @author. 

Next, we'll need to setup some paths, routes, and controllers. Since there's nothing new in really any of this, I'll breeze through it: 


<pre>
# features/support/paths.rb
<code class="ruby">
    when /the books page for the author with id "(\d+)"/
      books_author_path $1
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
# config/routes.rb

<code class="ruby">
ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  map.resources :books
  map.resources :authors, :member => "books"
end
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
# app/controllers/authors_controller.rb

<code class="ruby">
class AuthorsController < ApplicationController
  
  def books
    @author = Author.find params[:id]
    @books = Book.find :all, :params => {:author_id => @author.id}
  end
  
end
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
# app/views/authors/books.haml

<code class="haml">
.author
  .name
    = @author.name
  .books
    - @books.each do |book|
      .book
        .name
          = book.name
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
# app/models/author.rb

<code class="ruby">
class Author < ActiveResource::Base
  self.site = ''
end
</code>
</pre>

Now if we run "cucumber features/authors.feature", we'll get the following error: 

<pre>
$ cucumber features/authors.feature 
Feature: Viewing content related to authors

  Scenario: the books written by a particular author page    # features/authors.feature:3
    Given an author with many books                          # features/step_definitions/author_steps.rb:1

      ./features/step_definitions/webrat_steps.rb:11:in `/^I go to (.+)$/'
      features/authors.feature:5:in `When I view the books page for that author'
    Then I should see the name of that author                # features/step_definitions/author_steps.rb:10
    And I should see all of the books written by that author # features/step_definitions/author_steps.rb:14


    Logged Requests:
      Request: GET /authors/1.xml
      Response:
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <author>
          <name>author 1 name</name>
          <id type="integer">1</id>
        </author>


Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/authors.feature:3
</pre>

Basically, Dupe is telling us that it doesn't know how to interpret the request "/books.xml?author_id=1", which was caused by the line in our AuthorsController books action "@books = Book.find :all, :params => {:author_id => @author.id}". 

Dupe, by default, can only anticipate simply find(:all) and find(<id>) requests. To handle this service mock, we can create a custom intercept mock in features/dupe/custom_mocks/books.rb

<pre>
# features/dupe/custom_mocks/books.rb
<code class="ruby">
Get %r{/books\.xml\?author_id=(\d+)} do |author_id|
  Dupe.find(:books) {|b| b.author.id == author_id.to_i }
end
</code>
</pre>

Not unlike a cucumber step definition, this will create a regular expression matcher for the service url, which we then translate into a Dupe resource query. Notice that we pass a block to our Dupe.find method call. Checkout the API docs for more info, but essentially, this translates as "Find all the books written by the author with id X". One little gotcha: notice the to_i on the author_id (b.author.id is an integer, but the regular expression will return string matches). 

Now run your feature again and watch it pass!
